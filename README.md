**Chatterbox** is a family of state-of-the-art, open-source text-to-speech models by Resemble AI.

## Latest Release: Chatterbox Multilingual V3

**Chatterbox Multilingual V3** is the latest general-purpose multilingual TTS model in the Chatterbox family. It keeps the same 0.5B model size while improving speaker similarity, reducing hallucinations, and producing more natural, conversational speech across languages.

V3 is designed for broad language coverage like V2, but with stronger stability and more expressive generation. It is the recommended multilingual model for users who want one voice cloning model that works across many languages.

Alongside V3, we are releasing the **Single Language Pack**: dedicated finetunes for priority languages where tighter quality control, stronger language-specific behavior, and more specialized speech generation are valuable.

- **Broad Multilingual Coverage:** Designed as the main general-purpose multilingual Chatterbox model, supporting wide language coverage similar to V2.
- **Single Language Pack:** Dedicated single-language models provide stronger specialization and quality control where language- and regional-dialect-specific performance matters most.
- **More Consistent Speaker Similarity:** Improves voice identity and accent preservation across languages, making cross-language voice cloning more stable and reliable.
- **Reduced Hallucination:** V3 is optimized to reduce unwanted continuation, repetition, and off-prompt speech, especially in cases where earlier multilingual models were less stable.

For low-latency English voice agents, **Chatterbox-Turbo** is our most efficient model. Built on a streamlined 350M parameter architecture, **Turbo** delivers high-quality speech with less compute and VRAM than our previous models. We have also distilled the speech-token-to-mel decoder, previously a bottleneck, reducing generation from 10 steps to just **one**, while retaining high-fidelity audio output.

**Paralinguistic tags** are now native to the Turbo model, allowing you to use `[cough]`, `[laugh]`, `[chuckle]`, and more to add distinct realism. While Turbo was built primarily for low-latency voice agents, it excels at narration and creative workflows.

If you like the model but need to scale or tune it for higher accuracy, check out our competitively priced TTS service (<a href="https://resemble.ai">link</a>). It delivers reliable performance with ultra-low latency of sub 200ms—ideal for production use in agents, applications, or interactive media.

## Usage

##### Chatterbox-Turbo

```python
import torchaudio as ta
import torch
from chatterbox.tts_turbo import ChatterboxTurboTTS

# Load the Turbo model
model = ChatterboxTurboTTS.from_pretrained(device="cuda")

# Generate with Paralinguistic Tags
text = "Hi there, Sarah here from MochaFone calling you back [chuckle], have you got one minute to chat about the billing issue?"

# Generate audio (requires a reference clip for voice cloning)
wav = model.generate(text, audio_prompt_path="your_10s_ref_clip.wav")

ta.save("test-turbo.wav", wav, model.sr)
```

##### Chatterbox and Chatterbox-Multilingual

```python

import torchaudio as ta
from chatterbox.tts import ChatterboxTTS
from chatterbox.mtl_tts import ChatterboxMultilingualTTS

device = "cuda"  # or "cpu" / "mps"

# English example
model = ChatterboxTTS.from_pretrained(device=device)

text = "Ezreal and Jinx teamed up with Ahri, Yasuo, and Teemo to take down the enemy's Nexus in an epic late-game pentakill."
wav = model.generate(text)
ta.save("test-english.wav", wav, model.sr)

# Multilingual V3 examples
multilingual_model = ChatterboxMultilingualTTS.from_pretrained(device=device, t3_model="v3")
# To use the legacy V2 multilingual checkpoint, omit t3_model or pass t3_model="v2".

french_text = "Bonjour, comment ça va? Ceci est le modèle de synthèse vocale multilingue Chatterbox, il prend en charge 23 langues."
wav_french = multilingual_model.generate(french_text, language_id="fr")
ta.save("test-french.wav", wav_french, multilingual_model.sr)

chinese_text = "你好，今天天气真不错，希望你有一个愉快的周末。"
wav_chinese = multilingual_model.generate(chinese_text, language_id="zh")
ta.save("test-chinese.wav", wav_chinese, multilingual_model.sr)

# If you want to synthesize with a different voice, specify the audio prompt
AUDIO_PROMPT_PATH = "YOUR_FILE.wav"
wav = model.generate(text, audio_prompt_path=AUDIO_PROMPT_PATH)
ta.save("test-2.wav", wav, model.sr)
```

## Advanced Features & Optimizations

This repository has been deeply optimized and extended to serve as a production-ready engine. We have integrated cutting-edge features ported from multiple forks into a single unified `ChatterboxInference` pipeline, perfect for both local deployment and RunPod Serverless environments.

### ⚡ Bucketed CUDA Graph Acceleration (`use_fast=True`)
All models (Base, Multilingual, and Turbo) now natively support **Bucketed CUDA Graphs** via `generate_fast()`. This optimization eliminates CPU overhead and GPU synchronization bottlenecks (such as `.nonzero()` operations), yielding **2x - 4x non-batched inference speedups**. It automatically adjusts `cfg_weight=0.0` for Turbo models to bypass CFG overhead safely.

### 🧠 Intelligent Sentence Chunking & Pre-processing
Generating long texts all at once degrades prosody and increases hallucinations. Our pipeline automatically solves this:
- **Text Pre-processing**: Automatically cleans up artifacts, removes filler words ("um", "ahh"), and normalizes dots (e.g. "J.R.R." -> "J R R") before processing.
- **NLTK Sentence Splitting**: Automatically splits long paragraphs into sentences using `sent_tokenize`.
- **Seamless Stitching**: Recombines the generated audio chunks with a highly configurable `inter_sentence_silence_ms` to ensure natural pacing.

### 🛡️ Whisper-Based Hallucination Filtering (`num_candidates`)
TTS models occasionally hallucinate, especially on tricky names or punctuation. Our pipeline natively supports multi-candidate validation! 
By setting `num_candidates=3` (or any `N > 1`), the pipeline will:
1. Generate `N` distinct audio variations for a single sentence.
2. Quickly transcribe each candidate using an **in-memory cached Faster-Whisper** model.
3. Automatically select the audio chunk with the lowest Word Error Rate (WER).
*This practically eliminates hallucinations in production.*

### 🛠️ Using the High-Performance Pipeline

To leverage all these features in Python:
```python
from chatterbox_serverless.inference import ChatterboxInference

# Load the model with optimizations
model = ChatterboxInference.from_pretrained(model_type="multilingual", device="cuda")

# Generate with text pre-processing, chunking, CUDA graphs, and Whisper validation
wav = model.generate_fast(
    "Wow! That's incredibly fast. And it never hallucinates anymore!",
    language_id="en",
    normalize_text=True,
    sentence_split=True,
    inter_sentence_silence_ms=100,
    num_candidates=3,          # Generates 3 variations, picks the best WER!
)
```

**To run the RunPod Serverless endpoint:**
```shell
# Ensure you have the required serverless dependencies:
pip install ".[validate]"

# Start the RunPod handler locally
python rp_handler.py
```
You can test the endpoint using the scripts in `scripts/local_test.py` and inputs in `tests/serverless/test_input.json`.

## Original Chatterbox Tips
- **General Use (TTS and Voice Agents):**
  - Ensure that the reference clip matches the specified language tag. Otherwise, language transfer outputs may inherit the accent of the reference clip’s language. To mitigate this, set `cfg_weight` to `0`.
  - The default settings (`exaggeration=0.5`, `cfg_weight=0.5`) work well for most prompts across all languages.
  - If the reference speaker has a fast speaking style, lowering `cfg_weight` to around `0.3` can improve pacing.

- **Expressive or Dramatic Speech:**
  - Try lower `cfg_weight` values (e.g. `~0.3`) and increase `exaggeration` to around `0.7` or higher.
  - Higher `exaggeration` tends to speed up speech; reducing `cfg_weight` helps compensate with slower, more deliberate pacing.


## Built-in PerTh Watermarking for Responsible AI

Every audio file generated by Chatterbox includes [Resemble AI's Perth (Perceptual Threshold) Watermarker](https://github.com/resemble-ai/perth) - imperceptible neural watermarks that survive MP3 compression, audio editing, and common manipulations while maintaining nearly 100% detection accuracy.


## Watermark extraction

You can look for the watermark using the following script.

```python
import perth
import librosa

AUDIO_PATH = "YOUR_FILE.wav"

# Load the watermarked audio
watermarked_audio, sr = librosa.load(AUDIO_PATH, sr=None)

# Initialize watermarker (same as used for embedding)
watermarker = perth.PerthImplicitWatermarker()

# Extract watermark
watermark = watermarker.get_watermark(watermarked_audio, sample_rate=sr)
print(f"Extracted watermark: {watermark}")
# Output: 0.0 (no watermark) or 1.0 (watermarked)
```

## Cloud Deployment (RunPod Serverless)

This repository comes natively equipped with a highly optimized RunPod Serverless worker (`rp_handler.py`) and a pre-configured `Dockerfile.serverless` that ensures CUDA correctly builds without re-downloading massive Torch binaries.

### Deploying to RunPod:
1. Fork or clone this repository to your RunPod environment or a container registry.
2. Build the Docker image using the provided `Dockerfile.serverless`:
   ```bash
   docker build -t chatterbox-serverless -f Dockerfile.serverless .
   ```
3. Push to your registry and create a Serverless endpoint in RunPod.
4. Test the endpoint by sending a request payload mimicking `tests/serverless/test_input.json`.

The Serverless Endpoint supports powerful extra parameters:
- `num_candidates`: Generate N variations per sentence and use Whisper to pick the one with the lowest Word Error Rate (hallucination prevention).
- `inter_sentence_silence_ms`: Automatically stitch long text chunks with natural silences.
- `use_fast`: Automatically attempt to use the bucketed CUDA graph compilation for maximum throughput.
